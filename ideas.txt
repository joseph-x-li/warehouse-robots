create a "WIDE" environment (takes in multiple states, many actions, does it all at once)


// 05/06
Finish "double step" action thing for kernels :))
Add loop/multiple steps to sequential version :))

Compare correctness for both kernels :))
Finish evolution training shit (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06567.pdf) :))
ideas: local buffer for stepping (finished, but no significant improvement) :))

Weird sorting thing (for tensor kernel)

Parallel environments for GPU kernels (run n fields at one time in a kernel)


WRITE REPORT AND CALL IT A FUCKING YEAR
